ASC has similar requirements as flex for building/testing.

It requires the following software that is not under source control:

    jdk 1.5 or greater (see http://java.sun.com/products/archive/j2se/5.0_13/index.html)
    
    Ant 1.6.2 (see http://archive.apache.org/dist/ant/binaries/)

To build asc:

   cd build/java
   ant clean main
